USEFUL DEFINES AND MAKEFILE
===========================

This is the same blink with delay example, adding useful defines for common
register address and values and use the GNU make for build, check and flash to
target. The GNU make reference manual can be found at

https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html

The GNU make uses a Makefile file that map rules (or targets) to commands or
recipes. Each rule can have prerequisites that are run before each rule.
Checkout the GNU make reference manual and the Makefile to see what rules this
example has.

With the make, we can check if we can reach the target with the _check_ rule.

$ make check

To build the project, we can use the _build_ rule.

$ make build

And to flash into target with the binary file contents, the _flash_ rule.

$ make flash

Running the make command without any argument calls the _all_ rule. In this
example, the _all_ rule is empty and serves only as a placeholder. This rule
depends on _build_, so the _build_ rule will be executed before the _all_ rule.
In summary, the _all_ rule has the same effect as _build_ rule.
